UNDER DEVELOPMENT 
-----------------

The WREG program can be used to develop a regional estimation equation for streamflow characteristics that can be applied at an ungaged basin, or to improve the corresponding estimate at continuous-record streamflow gages with short records. The regional estimation equation results from a multiple-linear regression that relates observable basin characteristics, such as drainage area, to streamflow characteristics. WREG allows use of three approaches to estimating regression parameters: ordinary-least-squares (OLS), weighted-least-squares (WLS), and generalized-least-squares (GLS). All three approaches are based on the minimization of the sum of squares of differences between the gage values and the line or surface defined by the regression. WREG can also be used to test region of influence (RoI) regression models.
