Errors and warnings identified by WREG shell for original WREG sample files (distributed with v1.0).  

Most errors were due to duplicate years (with different flow values) in the file.  Errors were corrected by assuming that the second entry was meant for the for the following water year.  This also fixed many of the warnings identified by the WREG shell.

A few missing values (coded -9999) were removed from the annual time series files.  The number of years listed in the SiteInfo.txt file for these stations were modified to reflect these changes.
